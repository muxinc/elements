# Components

Below is a list of all available components in the `@mux/mux-uploader` package. For many cases, you can simply use `<mux-uploader>` for both
upload state management and UI. For more advanced use cases, you may use the subcomponents directly, using `<mux-uploader>` for upload state management or partial UI. See each component section below for details.

| Component name | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| `<mux-uploader>` | A fully-featured UI component. Also manages the uploading state.  **Required** |
| `<mux-uploader-drop>` | Enables drag-and-drop functionality for handling file input. |
| `<mux-uploader-file-select>` | Displays the system file-select dialog when clicked. |
| `<mux-uploader-pause>` | Displays a pause/resume button (with a disabled 'Pausing...' while a requested pause is pending completion of the current chunk upload) |
| `<mux-uploader-progress>` | Displays a progress indicator showing how much of your file has been uploaded. |
| `<mux-uploader-retry>` | Renders a "retry" button if the upload fails. |
| `<mux-uploader-status>` | Displays the upload status (e.g. completed or error statuses). |

Check out the [mux-uploader-modal.html](../../examples/vanilla-ts-esm/public/mux-uploader-modal.html) example application to see a real-world example of how these components can be used individually.

# `<mux-uploader>`

The main, "batteries included" component. Can be used as a full-featured UI or simply for chunked upload state and functional management.
To use for uploading state management only, you can style `<mux-uploader>` with a `display: none;`.

## Attributes

In addition to the attributes listed below, `<mux-uploader>` supports standard `HTMLElement` attributes such as `style` and `class`.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Default |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `endpoint`| `string` (URL) | The authenticated URL that your file will be uploaded to. Required. | `undefined` |
| `no-drop`| `boolean` | Hide/remove the drag & drop UI | `false` |
| `no-progress`| `boolean` | Hide/remove the upload progress UI (percentage and bar) | `false` |
| `no-status`| `boolean` | Hide/remove the upload status UI (errors, completion, offline) | `false` |
| `no-retry`| `boolean` | Hide/remove the retry UI button (shown if an upload fails before completion) | `false` |

| `type`| `"percentage" \| "bar" \| "radial"` (_Experimental_) | Show a different upload progress UI instead of a progress bar | `undefined` |
| `chunk-size` | `number` (kB, integer) | Specifies the size of each upload chunk, with the exception of the final chunk which may be smaller. This parameter must be in multiples of 256. | `undefined` |

This can occur on e.g. Safari browsers with files >= 4GB. | `false` |
| `file-ready` <sub><sup>Read only</sup></sub> | `boolean` | Indicates that the file has been selected. See the `"file-ready"` event, below | `false` |
| `upload-complete` <sub><sup>Read only</sup></sub> | `boolean` | Indicates that all chunks have been successfully uploaded. | `false` |

This can occur on e.g. Safari browsers with files >= 4GB. | `false` |

## Events

`<mux-uploader>` has a number of events for media uploading state, progress, and user interactions. Listen to these events using `addEventListener()`. All events related to chunk uploading match the events dispatched by [Upchunk](https://github.com/muxinc/upchunk/blob/master/README.md) under the hood.

| Event | Detail | Description |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| `file-ready` | The media [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) | Dispatched when the media file to upload has been retrieved from the file system, either from drag & drop or file selection, which will cause uploading to begin. As such, manually dispatching this event on `<mux-uploader>` will also initiate uploading with whatever file you provide in the event. |
| `chunkattempt` | `{ chunkNumber: number; chunkSize: number; }` | Dispatched before a chunk upload is attempted. Provides the chunk number and size of the about-to-be-attempted chunk. |
| `chunksuccess` | `{ chunk: number; attempts: number; response: XhrResponse }` | Dispatched when a chunk upload finishes successfully. Provides the chunk (number), number of attempts made to upload the chunk, and the response from the server. |
| `offline` | N/A | Dispatched when internet connection is lost. |
| `online` | `detail type` | Dispatched when internet connection is regained. |
| `pausedchange` | `boolean` `paused` state | Dispatched when the `paused` upload state changes. Note that pausing will wait until the currently uploading chunk finishes. |
| `progress` | The `number` percent | Dispatched whenever the chunked upload progress changes, including mid-chunk. Provides the percent of the file uploaded thus far. |
| `reset` | N/A | Dispatched to notify that the uploader's UI and state should be reset, e.g. when a user clicks "retry". As such, manually dispatching this event on `<mux-uploader>` will also prompt a reset (though you should only do this if an upload has failed). |
| `success` | `null` | Dispatched when all chunks have been successfully uploaded. |
| `uploadstart` | `{ file: File; chunkSize: number; }` | Dispatched when uploading the file begins. |
| `uploaderror` | `{ message: string; chunkNumber: number; attempts: number; }` | Dispatched when an error occurs while attempting to upload. Provides the number of (failed) attempts to upload a chunk, the chunk number, and the corresponding error message as a `detail`. |
