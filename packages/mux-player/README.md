# Introduction

`<mux-player>` is the official Mux-flavored video player web component.

The player UI is built on [`<media-chrome>`](https://github.com/muxinc/media-chrome/) and [`<mux-video>`](https://github.com/muxinc/elements/tree/main/packages/mux-video) drives the core video logic used to play Mux Video content that Just Works.

Be sure to check out our [official Mux documentation](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/mux-player), too!

# Installation

If you're using `npm` or `yarn`, install that way:

## Package manager

```
yarn add @mux/mux-player
```

or

```
npm i @mux/mux-player
```

Then, import the library into your application with either `import` or `require`:

```js
import '@mux/mux-player';
```

or

```js
require('@mux/mux-player');
```

## CDN option

Alternatively, use the CDN hosted version of this package:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@mux/mux-player"></script>
```

If you are using ECMAScript modules, you can also load the `mux-player.mjs` file with `type=module`:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@mux/mux-player/dist/mux-player.mjs"></script>
```

## Features and benefits

`<mux-player>` is a fully functional Video Player for the web with dirt simple integration to [Mux Video](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video) and [Mux Data](https://docs.mux.com/guides/data/monitor-hls-js).

`<mux-player>` provides a responsive UI based on player dimensions and stream type, automatic thumbnail previews and poster images, and built-in integration with Mux Data.

`<mux-player>` will use the optimal [Hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js) settings for Mux Video so you don't have to worry about that. `<mux-player>` will also periodically test new versions of Hls.js and upgrade to known stable versions so you don't have to worry about upgrading to a new version of Hls.js yourself.

## Usage

Loading this library in the browser will register a [custom web component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) for `<mux-player>`.

Now you are free to use this web component in your HTML, just as you would with the HTML5 `<video>` element.

```html
<body>
  <p></p>

  <mux-player
    playback-id="DS00Spx1CV902MCtPj5WknGlR102V5HFkDe"
    metadata-video-title="Big Buck Bunny"
    metadata-viewer-user-id="user-id-1234"
    stream-type="on-demand"
  ></mux-player>
</body>
```

### Metadata

To go above and beyond `metadata-*` attributes

To set other available metadata fields use the `metadata` property on the `<mux-player>` element like so:

```html
<mux-player
  playback-id="DS00Spx1CV902MCtPj5WknGlR102V5HFkDe"
  env-key="mux-data-env-key"
  metadata-video-title="Big Buck Bunny"
  metadata-viewer-user-id="user-id-1234"
>
</mux-player>

<script>
  const muxVideo = document.querySelector('mux-player');
  muxVideo.metadata = {
    experiment_name: 'landing_page_v3',
    video_content_type: 'clip',
    video_series: 'season 1',
  };
</script>
```

Take a look at the [metadata guide](https://docs.mux.com/guides/data/make-your-data-actionable-with-metadata) to view an exhaustive list of available values.

### Chromecast

Enable the [Google Cast](https://developers.google.com/cast) button in the controlbar by dropping in the `<script>` tag below in the `<head>` of your webpage.

```html
<script defer src="https://www.gstatic.com/cv/js/sender/v1/cast_sender.js?loadCastFramework=1"></script>
```

### prefer-mse

By default `<mux-player>` will try to use native playback via the underlying `<video/>` tag whenever possible. However, it can also instead use an in-code player when the browser browser supports [Media Source Extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Source_Extensions_API). This includes MSE in Mac OS Safari.

If you prefer to use the in-code MSE-based engine (currently hls.js) whenever possible, then pass in the `prefer-mse` attribute.

```html
<mux-player
  playback-id="DS00Spx1CV902MCtPj5WknGlR102V5HFkDe"
  metadata-video-title="Big Buck Bunny"
  metadata-viewer-user-id="user-id-1234"
  prefer-mse
>
</mux-player>
```
