# CSS Variables

This is the list of CSS variables for showing/hiding specific controls.

```
mux-player {
  /* Hide all controls at once */
  --controls: none;

  /* Target all sections by excluding the section prefix */
  --play-button: none;
  --live-button: none;
  --seek-backward-button: none;
  --seek-forward-button: none;
  --mute-button: none;
  --captions-button: none;
  --airplay-button: none;
  --pip-button: none;
  --fullscreen-button: none;
  --cast-button: none;
  --playback-rate-button: none;
  --volume-range: none;
  --time-range: none;
  --time-display: none;
  --title-display: none;
  --duration-display: none;
}
```

Each of the above can be paired with a prefix for `top`, `center`, `bottom`

```
mux-player {
  /* Target a specific section by prefixing the CSS var with (top|center|bottom) */
  --center-controls: none;
  --bottom-play-button: none;
}
```

Other CSS variables:

```
mux-player {
  /* The controls backdrop color */
  --controls-backdrop-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0%);

  /*
   * Controls how the media is sized and positioned inside of the <video> element
   * Supports everything the standard CSS properties support
   */
  --media-object-size: cover;
  --media-object-position: center;
}
```

Turning this off completely has implications on the accessibility of the controls as they may not meet [the contrast ratio requirements for WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#contrast-minimum) without it.

# CSS Parts

Mux Player uses a [shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) to encapsulate its styles and behaviors. As a result, it's not possible to target its internals with the usual CSS selectors. Instead, some components expose parts that can be targeted with the [CSS part selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part), or `::part()`.

```html
<style>
  mux-player::part(center play button) {
    display: none;
  }
</style>
<mux-player playback-id="DS00Spx1CV902MCtPj5WknGlR102V5HFkDe"></mux-player>
```

Supported parts: `top`, `center`, `bottom`, `layer`, `media-layer`, `poster-layer`, `vertical-layer`, `centered-layer`, `gesture-layer`, `poster`, `live`, `play`, `button`, `seek-backward`, `seek-forward`, `mute`, `captions`, `airplay`, `pip`, `fullscreen`, `cast`, `playback-rate`, `volume`, `range`, `time`, `display`, `video`

CSS parts allow you to style each part individually with a selector like `::part(center play button)` or target multiple elements if the part is assigned to multiple elements internally, usage `::part(button)`. Every CSS property can be declared in the selector, this makes it a very powerful API.

# Slots

Mux player can accept a [slotted element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_templates_and_slots) as a poster image. The HTML would look similar to the following snippet:

```html
<mux-player playback-id="VcmKA6aqzIzlg3MayLJDnbF55kX00mds028Z65QxvBYaA">
  <img slot="poster" src="https://image.mux.com/VcmKA6aqzIzlg3MayLJDnbF55kX00mds028Z65QxvBYaA/thumbnail.webp">
</mux-player>
```

The markup is more verbose but it comes with some benefits:

- The poster image loads faster as it's picked up by the browser earlier.
- Allows you to use responsive images with the img `srcset` attribute.
