# Upgrading Mux Player from v1.x.x to v2.x.x

Version 2 of Mux Player introduces a new default theme that comes with a couple key differences to be aware of when upgrading.

## Colors

In the previous version there were two main options for controlling the overall colors of controls and UI elements.

- **Primary color** - Affects the color of icons and text
- **Secondary color** - Affects the background color of controls

In the new theme we have introduced a third option: **Accent color**.

Accent color mostly affects interactions, like a button background color on hover. It's also used for the time range progress bar background showing how much of a video has been viewed.

You can override the accent color using a new CSS variable:

```html
<mux-player accent-color="#f97316"></mux-player>
```

```jsx
<MuxPlayer accentColor="#f97316" />
```

## Pre-playback UI

Before a video is played, a large central play button is now shown on the video instead of the control bar along the bottom. This is a more obvious call-to-action for the user and the control bar will show immediately after the video starts playing. You don't have to do anything for this when upgrading but as it's a core change in how the player works we wanted to highlight it here.

## Stream type property no longer required

In the previous version you needed to specify the stream type of a video like this:

```html
<mux-player
  playback-id="..."
  stream-type="on-demand"
></mux-player>
```

This is no longer required as the stream type will be automatically derived by the player. You can remove this property after upgrading when using the new theme.

If you choose to continue using the old theme, or switch to a theme that by default shows controls that differ on page load depending on the stream type, you may want to continue providing the stream type property. This would avoid a possible scenario where one set of controls is shown before quickly switching to a different set of controls after the stream type has been figured out.

## Upgrading to Mux Player V2 while keeping the old theme

The old theme is still available if you have a need to use it while still upgrading the player.

You can import it like this:

```javascript
import "@mux/mux-player/themes/classic";
```

and...

### Using the web component

```html
<mux-player theme="classic"></mux-player>
```

### Or with React

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <MuxPlayer theme="classic"></MuxPlayer>
}
```
